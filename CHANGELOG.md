#### Breaking changes

##### Yagr instances

-   Make charts adaptive by default.

-   Removed `refPoints` and simplified scale min/max calculations.
-   Renamed `toggleSerieVisibility` to `setVisible`, and changed signature to `setVisible(lineId: string | null, show: boolean): void`.
-   Changed `setFocus` signature to `setFocus(lineId: string | null, focus: boolean): void`.

##### Scales

-   Removed `maxTicks` field. It was never worked.

##### Typings

-   Splited different series options by `type`, which allows to enable more comprehensible completions in TypeScript.
-   Renamed: `InterpolationSetting` -> `InterpolationType`.
